# React Weather App - Connected to Flask backend
This is a self-directed project. This is a project intended to consolidate my ongoing learning of React.js and TypeScript.

## Goals
This project is being developed in tandem with my python weather app. I wanted to practise building a separate back and front end, and then connecting the two together (so far I have built full-stack applications using Ruby on Rails). 

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Process
I first set up my React project using Vite: 

`npm create vite@latest`\
Selected framework: `React`\
Selected variant: `TypeScript`\
`cd react-weather-app`\
`npm install`\
`npm run dev`

After setting up, I quickly made a Header, Card and Footer components. As I knew I would need to make requests to my Flask backend, I guessed that useEffect would need to be used - some research confirmed this. Setting this up was simple as I'd had practice doing this with my JLPTrainer react app.
